# Protocol — the shared language of the UI and the Agent Host

`packages/protocol` is the bottom layer package, with 0 dependencies. **Nothing can cross a process boundary in a type that is not here.**

## 1. Transport layer

- WebSocket, 1 text frame = 1 JSON message.
- Handshake immediately after connecting: `{ type: 'hello', token, protocolVersion }` → on mismatch, close immediately (with an error code). The token is generated when the host starts; in dev it is passed through an environment variable.
- Two kinds, by direction: **RPC** (request/response, UI→host) and the **event stream** (host→UI, one-way push).

```ts
// envelope
type Rpc     = { kind: 'rpc';   id: string; method: string; params: unknown }
type RpcRes  = { kind: 'res';   id: string; ok: true; result: unknown }
             | { kind: 'res';   id: string; ok: false; error: ProtocolError }
type Push    = { kind: 'event'; seq: number; sessionId?: string; event: NormalizedEvent }
```

- `seq` is a monotonically increasing number assigned by the host. On reconnect, `subscribe({ afterSeq })` replays what was missed — **the key device that stops a reconnect being a loss of state.**
- The host keeps recent events in a ring buffer (+ the store). If afterSeq is outside the buffer it sends `resync_required` and the UI reloads the snapshot.

## 2. NormalizedEvent (product spec §6.2, made concrete)

The **canonical union lives in `packages/protocol/src/events.ts`** — every field, every
default, and the reasoning comments. This list is the map, grouped by what the event is
for; the golden-fixture test (`protocol.test.ts`) fails the moment a type exists in the
schema without appearing here-adjacent fixtures, so the schema cannot quietly outgrow
its own examples.

```ts
type NormalizedEvent =
  // conversation content (persisted via seq except where noted)
  | { type: 'message_delta';    sessionId, role, text }         // streaming body
  | { type: 'reasoning_delta';  sessionId, text?, estTokens? }  // #58: codex gives summary text; claude only a token estimate
  | { type: 'user_message';     sessionId, seq, text, from? }   // human input, or another session's instruction (FR-11)
  | { type: 'tool_call';        sessionId, callId, summary: ToolSummary }
  | { type: 'tool_result';      sessionId, callId, ok, summary }
  | { type: 'message_image';    sessionId, mime, data, path?, note? }  // #40; note explains display failures
  | { type: 'compaction';       sessionId, failed, reason?, before?, after? }  // FR-14 marker
  // in-turn progress (display-only, never persisted)
  | { type: 'activity';         sessionId, activity|null }      // compacting / reviewing
  | { type: 'plan_update';      sessionId, steps: {text, status}[] }  // #58: codex turn/plan/updated snapshot
  | { type: 'tool_output_delta';sessionId, callId, text }       // #58: live command output tail
  // things a person must answer
  | { type: 'approval_request'; sessionId, requestId, detail: ApprovalDetail }
  | { type: 'approval_resolved';sessionId, requestId, decision }
  | { type: 'question_request'; sessionId, requestId, questions: Question[] }  // AskUserQuestion
  | { type: 'question_resolved';sessionId, requestId }
  // session state and gauges
  | { type: 'turn_complete';    sessionId }
  | { type: 'state_change';     sessionId, state: SessionState, reason? }
  | { type: 'usage_update';     sessionId, tokens: TokenUsage }
  | { type: 'context_update';   sessionId, used, window, exactness: 'exact'|'estimate' }
  | { type: 'limit_reached';    sessionId, resumeAt?, usedPercent?, windowMins? }
  | { type: 'session_title';    sessionId, title, auto }        // auto=false: human-given, never overwritten
  | { type: 'settings_changed'; sessionId, model, effort, verbosity, serviceTier? }  // #30: a non-human hand changed settings
  | { type: 'files_touched';    sessionId, paths: string[] }    // FR-2 conflict detection, FR-5 highlighting
  | { type: 'history_synced';   sessionId, added }              // a conversation continued elsewhere was caught up
  | { type: 'session_deleted';  sessionId }
  // app-scoped (sessionId optional — not every fact belongs to a conversation)
  | { type: 'update_status';    status: UpdateStatus }          // #43
  | { type: 'fs_changed';       projectId, dirs: string[] }     // #34
  | { type: 'error';            sessionId?, error: ProtocolError }
```

`ApprovalDetail` is **structured in advance by the adapter** so it carries what is needed to judge in-place banner approval (FR-3):

```ts
type ApprovalDetail =
  | { kind: 'command';   command: string; cwd: string }               // approvable from the banner
  | { kind: 'file_edit'; path: string; diffPreview: string; multi: boolean } // "needs review"
  | { kind: 'other';     raw: string }                                 // always "needs review"
```

The judgement logic (core/approval) decides from `kind` alone — a worked example of anti-corruption keeping the UI from needing to know per-tool raw formats.

## 3. RPC methods (summary)

| Group | Methods | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| agents | `createSession, send, respondApproval, interrupt, archiveSession, resumeSession` | product spec §6.2 |
| git (dev) | `git.status, git.log, git.branches, git.diff, git.checkout` | in prod the same contract via Tauri invoke |
| fs (dev) | `fs.listDir, fs.readFile, fs.watchProject` | 〃 |
| store (dev) | `store.loadWorkspace, store.saveWorkspace, store.appendMessages, …` | 〃 |
| usage | `usage.weekly(range)` | resident in the host |

The request and response types of the git/fs/store RPCs are **1:1 with the port interfaces**. Deliberate duplication — the port is the original contract, and RPC and Tauri invoke are just two carriers of that contract.

## 3.1 How a path is spelled ([#47](https://github.com/ijun17/centralu/issues/47))

Two kinds of path cross this boundary, and they are not the same kind of thing.

| Kind | Examples | Encoding |
|---|---|---|
| **Project-relative** | the `rel` of every `fs` RPC, `FsEntry.path`, git's file paths, the path a message links to | **POSIX (`/`), always**, on every host and every platform |
| **Native** | `ProjectInfo.path` — a project's directory | the OS's own spelling, **never taken apart, never normalised** |

**Why relative paths are normalised.** `packages/ui` is not allowed to know which OS it is on
(see [platform-abstraction.md](platform-abstraction.md); it is enforced by `tooling/styles.test.ts`).
A relative path carrying a native separator would have to be read one way on Windows and another
way everywhere else — in the UI — which is exactly the branch that rule forbids. Git settles it
from the other side too: its own path format is POSIX on every platform and its output reaches the
screen unchanged, so any other choice would mean converting git's answers for nothing.

**Why absolute paths are not.** A project's directory is chosen by the OS folder picker and handed
straight back to the OS — a terminal's cwd, a process's cwd, the file manager. Nothing manipulates
it. Normalising it would be lossy for no gain: `C:\Users\me` has no POSIX spelling that Windows
will accept back.

**Where the conversion happens.** At the host's edge, where a relative path meets a real
filesystem, and nowhere else. `@cc/protocol`'s `wireSegments` · `wireBaseName` · `wireJoin` are the
only place the separator is written down; `osPathBaseName` is for the other kind. On macOS and
Linux the conversion is the identity, which is why getting it wrong cost nothing until it was
written down.

This does **not** make the app run on Windows ([#14](https://github.com/ijun17/centralu/issues/14)).
It is the prerequisite: one named assumption instead of twenty-one anonymous ones, so a Windows
build fails for reasons that are about Windows. `tooling/paths.test.ts` fails the build on a
twenty-second.

## 4. Schema and version rules (the C6 defence)

- Every message is defined by a zod schema and validated **only at the boundary** (once, on receipt. Re-validating internally is forbidden — performance).
- `protocolVersion` is a single integer. Compatibility rules:
  - **Additions are free** (a new event type, a new optional field) — the version does not change.
  - The receiver **must ignore event types and fields it does not know** (zod `passthrough` + a fallback case in the discriminated union).
  - Removing a field or changing its meaning = version increment = rejected at the handshake. **Avoid this wherever possible** — adding a new field and keeping the old one for one milestone is always cheaper.
- Golden tests: freeze sample message JSON per version as fixtures, and when the schema changes, CI verifies that the past fixtures still parse.

## 5. Error model

```ts
type ProtocolError = {
  code: 'adapter_crashed' | 'tool_not_installed' | 'not_logged_in'
      | 'session_not_found' | 'rate_limited' | 'version_mismatch' | 'internal'
  message: string          // a human-readable explanation (must be displayable in the UI as is)
  retryable: boolean
  data?: unknown           // extra information per code (rate_limited → resumeAt etc.)
}
```

- code is a closed set. The UI branches on code and only displays message. Branching on string matching is forbidden.
- An adapter's raw errors (SDK exceptions, process exit codes) are converted into this shape inside the host.

# Security boundaries and residual limits

These controls reduce risks from untrusted repository and agent content. They do not
sandbox an already-executing process with the user's OS privileges.

## Inter-agent content

Worker reports retain their provenance in stored history and the UI. Reports from
unprofiled workers to privileged/profiled sessions become host-authored notifications;
ordinary orchestrator/manager/coordinator instructions retain their content and attachments.
Worker-originated records are excluded from privileged conversation memory. Read-session,
preview and recall text is framed as structured untrusted data, not human authorization.

JSON framing prevents ambiguous transcript-line assembly; it does **not** make text safe
for an LLM to obey or eliminate prompt injection. Tool scopes and typed approval checks
remain the deterministic authorization boundaries.

## Repository configuration and project trust

A project the user has not marked trusted cannot change how its sessions ask for approval
(#92). Claude sessions load only the user's own settings (`settingSources: ['user']`), so
the repository's `.claude/` settings, local settings, hooks, commands and `CLAUDE.md` do
not apply. Codex threads are started with the project's paths marked `untrusted` for that
thread only, and `project_doc_max_bytes = 0`. That keeps the repository's `.codex/config.toml`,
hooks, exec rules and `AGENTS.md` out, and it stops Codex from persisting the folder as
trusted in `~/.codex/config.toml` on first use. The user's own settings in `~/.claude` and
`~/.codex` still decide under the `normal` preset. The orchestrator reads no settings files.

Limits:

- Trust is read when a session's tool process starts. Changing it affects running sessions
  at their next restart or resume.
- Codex still loads repository skills (`.codex/skills`, `.agents/skills`) in untrusted
  folders. They are instructions only; whatever they lead the model to do still passes approval.
- The Codex behaviour is verified from Codex source and the installed binary's strings, not
  by a logged-in run.

## Local transport

The host listens on loopback and requires a token that is not blank — whitespace-only is
refused at construction, matching the trim the browser entry point already applies.
Browser/WebView connections must additionally match the explicit origin allowlist, which
`CC_HOST_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated) replaces when set. A client without an Origin
header still needs the token; Origin is a browser defense, not native-client identity.
Literal `Origin: null` is rejected. A rejected upgrade is logged by the host, because the
browser does not hand the 403 to the page. Development tokens should be generated per launch and shared
only with the intended local client. Mock/demo modes do not connect to the host.

## Project files and native handoff

Existing filesystem targets are checked against the canonical project root. Symlinks
resolving inside that root are supported; outside targets and dangling links are rejected.
Text/image reads require a regular-file descriptor, bound allocation/read size, and compare
opened-file identity. Native reveal/trash checks are additional absolute/no-symlink checks;
they are **not** independent proof of project containment. Opening in an IDE does not fall
back to a generic OS opener that could execute repository-authored content.

Limits:

- An in-root hardlink shares an inode with its other names. Canonical pathname checks do
  not establish where that inode originated, so they do not close hardlink-based access.
- Validation and OS pathname use are separate operations. Same-user replacement races
  remain, especially for move/import/list/watch and native handoff. Descriptor identity
  checks narrow the read window but are not an atomic descriptor-relative filesystem sandbox.
- Project containment does not confine provider tools or terminal commands intentionally
  executed with the user's permissions. Approval policy and OS isolation are separate layers.

Do not expand the scope of these claims without stronger implementation and platform-level
validation. In particular, do not describe these checks as complete filesystem isolation.
